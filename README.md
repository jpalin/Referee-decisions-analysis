# Referee-decisions-analysis
How referees’ experience, game
management and preconceptions impact
football games in the English Premier
League

This repository contains the R code created to assess several questions into refereeing decisions through data and statistical analysis.

The questions investigated were as follows:

Does a referee issuing early cards lead to a fairer match?

Do referees perform differently when judging disciplinary actions?

Are referees influenced by previous games they have officiated?

Does a referee’s game management change after the first card?
